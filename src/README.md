## How to start a server

Run Server_main.java file from the **server** package. 
The server can take a port number from the command line with arguments (-p portNumber).  
_For example: "Server\_main -p 1234" runs the server on port 1234._ 
If a port is not specified or the arguments are invalid, the server is run on the default port 4444.

## How to start a Client
The client can be run by running Client_main.java. Then, enter the IP address and port that the server is located on
in the appropriate fields in the dialog that opens.
